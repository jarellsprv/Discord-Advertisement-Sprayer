I made this for advertising my shop. Use it if you want, just don't abuse it and be annoying ðŸ˜¡

It uses 1 token per thread
Pulls all channel IDs for all servers and sends a message at a set interval between channels, and recycles them at a set interval
Generates invites for servers that you advertised in (toggable)

Made in Python 1.13

Install requests and that's it
