I made this for advertising my shop. Use it if you want, just don't abuse it and be annoying ğŸ˜¡

Features: 
It uses 1 token per thread
Pulls all channel IDs for all servers and sends a message at a set interval between channels, and recycles them at a set interval
Generates analytics for servers that you advertised in (toggleable), including server Invite, Member count, online count, and messages per minute.

the filter channels is faulty so its better to turn it off

Made in Python 1.13

Install requests and that's it

Run start.bat to start the code
